# KAST podcast app

A responsive podcast app built with React, using iTunes API to fetch the podcast catalog. Another API is used to convert the received RSS feed into a JSON file, so that the episode details and mp3 files can be reached.

### Features to implement
Please note that this is a work in progress. My plans for this app include adding Firebase authentication, enabling the user to compose their own list of favourite podcasts and adding pagination in the episodes listing.

#####TOOLS USED: 
React, React Router, Sass, Axios
