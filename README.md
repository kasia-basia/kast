# KAST podcast app

### Overview
A responsive podcast app I designed and built with React, using iTunes API to fetch the podcast catalog. Another API is used to convert the received RSS feed into a JSON file, so that the episode details and mp3 files can be reached.

### Features to implement
Please note that this is a work in progress. My plans for this app include adding Firebase authentication, enabling the user to compose their own list of favourite podcasts and adding pagination in the episodes listing.

### Tools used: 
Development: React, React Router, Sass, Axios 
Design: Affinity Designer
